[Porfolio de Ramiro](https://ramirocosa.is-a.dev/)

### Description

This project is a **personal web portfolio** built using a template designed for simplicity and adaptability. It has been customized to showcase my skills, projects, and professional background. The goal is to demonstrate my ability to adapt existing frameworks, personalize designs, and implement effective solutions for web-based applications.

By using this repository, I aim to highlight my skills in **frontend development**, **dynamic content handling**, and modern web technologies.

### Inspiration and Template

This project is based on the [MidudevÂ´s minimalist-portfolio-json](https://github.com/midudev/minimalist-portfolio-json).  
The original template provided the foundational structure, which I have customized to include:

- **My Personal Branding:** Custom sections for my projects, skills, and experience.
- **Dynamic Content Integration:** Modified the template to allow for easy updates via JSON files.
- **Styling Adjustments:** Tailored the design for a minimalist look and mobile responsiveness.

### Features

- **Responsive Design:** Fully mobile-friendly and optimized for different screen sizes.
- **Lightweight Frameworks:** Leveraging modern, minimalistic technologies for speed and simplicity.
- **Custom Modifications:** Personalized to reflect my skills and career goals.
